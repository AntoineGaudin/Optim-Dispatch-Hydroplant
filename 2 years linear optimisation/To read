In this folder, we look at the electricity price in Luzon, Philippines, for 2 years. The optimal dispatch is simulated.

**Objective function**

Maximize the revenue from the electricity sold, on the wholesale market, called WESM.
Ancillary markets are not considered here.

**Variables to optimize**

Chg = Binary, is equal to 1 if the pump works in reverse, and electricity is consumed
Dis = Binary, is equal to 1 if the pump discharge water, and electricity is produced
P_Charge_kW = Continuous, is equal to the reverse Power in kW, used from the grid
P_Discharge_kW = Continuous, is the Power sent to the grid, in kW
Hydro_m3 = Continous, is the quantity of water in the reservoir, in m3.
Hydro_flow_lost = Flow of Water not used for the electricity production and used from the reservoir, m3 per hour

**Key inputs to the model**

Electricity price, wholesale, Pesos/PhP per kWh.
Rainfall, in m3 per hour. 
Maximum/minumum ammount of water in the reservoir, m3. 
Maximum/minimum power of the turbine, the minimum can be negative, kW.
Starting/finishing ammount of water in the reservoir, m3. 
Minimum water flow to be dispersed in the river, m3 per day. 
Efficiency factor in the energy conversion (Kinetic Energy-Turbine-Electricity), no unit.
Heigh of the dam, to calculate the kinetic energy of the water, meter. 

**Constrains**

Contrain on the maximum of P_Charge_kW  
Contrain on the maximum of P_Discharge_kW
No charge and discharge at the same time
Minimum flow of water exiting to the river
Formula to ensure contuinity of the water level
Water level, m3, at the strat and end of the simulation
